```

#### ⏱️ TIMEOUT ERROR
```
⏱️ TIMEOUT ERROR

💡 Possible causes:
   - Server is processing too slowly
   - Network latency is high
   - Server is overloaded
```

#### 🚫 CORS ERROR
```
🚫 CORS ERROR
   Reason: Server blocked cross-origin request

💡 Solution:
   - Friend needs to enable CORS on server
   - Add CORS headers to API responses
```

#### ⚠️ SERVER ERROR
```

   Reason: Server encountered an internal error

💡 Action needed:
   - Check server logs on friend's laptop
   - Verify API endpoint is correct
   - Ensure server dependencies are installed
```

### ✅ Startup Connection Test

When page loads:
```
🔍 ========== TESTING SERVER CONNECTION ==========
🌐 Server URL: http://10.25.26.187:8000/api/v1/analyze
📡 Attempting to connect to: http://10.25.26.187:8000/api/v1/health

✅ SERVER CONNECTED!
   Status: 200
   Server is ready to analyze content
================================================
```

OR if server not running:
```
❌ SERVER NOT CONNECTED
   This is normal if server isn't running yet
   Error: Failed to fetch

💡 To enable analysis:
   1. Friend starts server on laptop (10.25.26.187:8000)
   2. Both laptops must be on same WiFi
   3. Reload this page after server starts
