# 🎯 TEST THE FIX NOW!

## What Was Wrong:
NDTV article showing:
```
textLength: 48 ← Too little!
articlesFound: 0
⚠️ Insufficient content
```

## What I Fixed:
1. Improved content extraction to find NDTV paragraphs
2. Added specific selectors for news sites
3. Better ad filtering (keeps content, removes ads)
4. Finds containers with most <p> tags

## Test It:

### 1. Reload Extension
```
chrome://extensions/ → Click reload icon
```

### 2. Open NDTV Article
```
https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indian-origin-us-defence-strategist-ashley-tellis-arrested-over-secret-documents-meeting-chinese-officials-9457048
```

### 3. Check Console (F12)
Should now see:
```
✓ Page Type: news-portal
✓ Found main content: DIV.sp-cn
🛡️ Blocked 50 ad elements, extracted 2500 characters
textLength: 2500 ← Much better!
```

## Expected Result:
- ✅ **textLength: 1000-3000** (not 48!)
- ✅ **No "Insufficient content" error**
- ✅ **Extension ready to analyze**

---

**Go test it now! The extraction should work!** 🚀
