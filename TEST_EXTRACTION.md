# Content Extraction Fix - Test Instructions

## What Changed
Completely rewrote the text extraction logic to be **simpler and more effective**:

### Old Approach (542 chars)
- Complex logic with DIVs, direct text nodes, nested processing
- Too many filters and conditions
- Missing actual paragraphs

### New Approach (Should get 2000+ chars)
- **Simple**: Just get ALL `<p>` tags from the cleaned article
- Skip only:
  - Very short paragraphs (< 10 chars)
  - Ad-related text
  - High link density (> 70% links)
- Also captures headings for context
- Fallback to all text if < 300 chars

## Testing Steps

1. **Reload Extension**
   - Go to: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click the reload icon for your extension

2. **Reload NDTV Article**
   - Refresh the NDTV page: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/indian-origin-us-defence-strategist-ashley-tellis-arrested-over-secret-documents-meeting-chinese-officials-9457048

3. **Open Console**
   - Press F12 → Console tab

4. **Check Output**
   - Look for: `📝 Found X paragraph tags`
   - Look for: `📊 Extracted Y characters from X paragraphs`
   - **Expected**: Y should be **2000-4000+** (not 542!)

5. **Open Popup**
   - Click extension icon
   - Check if article text length is shown

## What to Look For

✅ **Success Indicators**:
- Console shows: "📝 Found 20-50 paragraph tags" (NDTV has many paragraphs)
- Console shows: "📊 Extracted 2000-4000+ characters"
- Console shows: "textLength: 2000+" (not 542)
- Popup shows article detected with substantial text

❌ **Still broken if**:
- Console shows: "📝 Found 0-5 paragraph tags"
- Console shows: "📊 Extracted 542 characters" (same as before)
- Console shows: "⚠️ Only got X chars from paragraphs, using all text as fallback"

## Why This Should Work

NDTV articles have **many `<p>` tags** inside the article container. The old code was:
1. Looking at DIVs (complex)
2. Getting direct text nodes only (missing nested paragraphs)
3. Too much filtering

New code:
1. Gets ALL `<p>` tags (simple)
2. Minimal filtering (just ads and very short text)
3. Should capture the entire article!
