### ⚠️ ISSUE: CORS Error (Easy to Fix!)

```
Access to fetch at 'http://10.25.26.187:8000/api/v1/analyze' 
from origin 'https://www.ndtv.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ Server IS running
- ✅ Network connection works
- ✅ Extension can reach the server
- ❌ Server is blocking cross-origin requests (security feature)

**The Fix:**
Friend needs to add CORS headers to the server (see **CORS_FIX_NEEDED.md**)
