# 🚨 Mixed Content Error - SOLUTION

## The Problem

Chrome is blocking your HTTP server request because NDTV uses HTTPS:

```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://www.ndtv.com/...' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://10.25.26.187:8000/api/v1/analyze'. 
This request has been blocked.
```

## ✅ SOLUTION: Allow Insecure Content (Hackathon Quick Fix)

### Step 1: Enable Insecure Content in Chrome

**While on the NDTV page:**

1. Look at the **address bar** (where the URL is)
2. You'll see a **shield icon** 🛡️ or **lock icon** 🔒
3. Click on it
4. Look for: **"Site settings"** or **"Permissions for this site"**
5. Find: **"Insecure content"** 
6. Change from: **"Block (default)"** 
7. Change to: **"Allow"**
8. **Reload the page**

### Step 2: Alternative - Chrome Flags (More Permanent)

1. Go to: `chrome://flags/`
2. Search for: **"insecure"**
3. Find: **"Block insecure private network requests"**
4. Change to: **"Disabled"**
5. Click **"Relaunch"** button

## 🔧 OR - Better Solution: Make Server HTTPS

If you have time, ask your friend to run the server with HTTPS:

### Quick HTTPS Setup (Python)

**On friend's laptop:**

```bash
# Install pyOpenSSL
pip install pyopenssl

# Generate self-signed certificate (quick & dirty)
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 1
```

**Then update server to use HTTPS:**
```python
# In their Flask/FastAPI app:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, 
            ssl_context=('cert.pem', 'key.pem'))  # Add this
```

**Then update extension URLs to HTTPS:**
- Change `http://10.25.26.187:8000` 
- To: `https://10.25.26.187:8000`

## 📊 Current Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Paragraph Extraction** | ✅ PERFECT (10 paragraphs, 2912 chars) |
| **Content Quality** | ✅ EXCELLENT (all article text captured) |
| **Server IP** | ✅ Configured (10.25.26.187:8000) |
| **Connection** | ❌ **BLOCKED (Mixed Content)** |

---

## 🎯 Recommended Action

**For Hackathon (Fastest):**
1. Click shield icon in address bar on NDTV page
2. Allow insecure content
3. Reload page
4. Server connection should work!

**For Production (Later):**
- Set up proper HTTPS with SSL certificate
- Or use a reverse proxy (nginx) with HTTPS

---

## ✅ Verification

After allowing insecure content, you should see:

```
✅ POST http://10.25.26.187:8000/api/v1/analyze 200 OK
✅ Analysis complete
```

Instead of:
```
❌ Mixed Content: This request has been blocked
```

---

## 🚀 Summary

**Everything else is working perfectly:**
- ✅ Extension loads
- ✅ Icons working
- ✅ UI looks great
- ✅ Content extraction: **10 paragraphs, 2912 characters**
- ✅ Ad blocking: 12 ads removed
- ✅ Server IP configured

**Just need to:**
1. Allow insecure content in Chrome (1 click!)
2. Make sure friend's server is running
3. Test the connection!

You're **99% done!** Just this one Chrome security setting! 🎉
