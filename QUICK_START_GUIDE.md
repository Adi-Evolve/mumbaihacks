## üì® SEND TO YOUR FRIEND

**Message:**
```
Hey! I need you to set up the crisis detection server for the hackathon.

1. Open this file: COMPLETE_CRISIS_SERVER_PROMPT_FOR_FRIEND.md
2. Copy the entire file
3. Paste it into Claude or GPT-4
4. Say: "Implement this complete server"
5. Claude will generate server.py
6. Run it on your device (10.25.26.187:8002)

It adds crisis detection with WHO/USGS/UN verification!

Let me know when it's running so I can test.

Time: ~30 minutes
```

**File to send:** `COMPLETE_CRISIS_SERVER_PROMPT_FOR_FRIEND.md`

## üß™ AFTER SERVER IS RUNNING

### Test 1: Earthquake (COOLEST FEATURE!)
In your extension, analyze this text:
```
A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Turkey today according to USGS, 
causing extensive damage in the region.
```

**You should see:**
- üåç Crisis badge: "EARTHQUAKE - HIGH SEVERITY"
- ‚úÖ USGS verification with REAL earthquake data
- Official source link to USGS website
- Public summary explaining the situation

### Test 2: COVID Misinformation
```
New COVID variant is 100% deadly says anonymous source. 
Government is hiding the truth from the public!
```

**You should see:**
- ü¶† Crisis badge: "PANDEMIC"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UNVERIFIED warning
- "No WHO confirmation found"
- Warning not to share

### Test 3: War News with Bias
```
Terrorists attacked the settlement yesterday. The regime continues 
its aggression while freedom fighters defend their homeland.
```

**You should see:**
- ‚öîÔ∏è Crisis badge: "WAR"
- ‚öñÔ∏è Bias detected warning
- List of biased terms (terrorist, regime)
- "Verify with neutral sources: UN, Red Cross"
