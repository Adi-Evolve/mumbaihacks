## What Works Now

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Search bar in popup | ✅ Working |
| Text analysis | ✅ Working |

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the New Popup
After reloading extension, test all 3 methods above.

### 2. If URL Analysis Doesn't Work
The background script needs updating to fetch URLs. Current implementation:
- Text analysis: ✅ Works (sends directly to server)
- Current page: ✅ Works (content script extracts content)
- URL analysis: ⚠️ Needs background script to fetch external URLs

### 3. Optional: Remove Old Files
Once everything works, you can delete:
- `popup_old.html`
- `popup_old.js`
- `aiSearchPopup.js` (not needed anymore)
