## 📋 Next Steps at Hackathon

### Step 1: Reload Extension
1. Go to: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find your extension
3. Click the **Reload** icon (circular arrow)

### Step 2: Verify Server is Running
Ask your friend to:
1. Start the Python backend server
2. Make sure it's running on port **8000**
3. Check the terminal shows: `Running on http://0.0.0.0:8000` or `Running on http://10.25.26.187:8000`

### Step 3: Test Connection
1. Open any NDTV article (or supported news site)
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click the extension icon
4. Look for:
   - ✅ `✓ Detected content type: article`
   - ✅ `📊 Extracted XXXX characters`
   - ✅ **No connection errors!** (should successfully POST to server)

### Step 4: Check Analysis Results
In the popup, you should see:
- **Misinformation Score:** XX%
- **Confidence:** High/Medium/Low
- **Status:** "Analysis complete" (not "Server not connected")

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you see "Connection Refused" errors:

**Check 1: Server Running?**
```bash
# Friend's laptop should show:
python app.py
# Output: * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Check 2: Firewall**
- Friend needs to allow incoming connections on port 8000
- Windows: Check Windows Firewall settings
- Mac: Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall

**Check 3: Same Network?**
- Both laptops must be on the **same WiFi network**
- Can't mix WiFi and Ethernet unless properly configured

**Check 4: Ping Test**
On your laptop, open PowerShell:
```powershell
ping 10.25.26.187
```
Should see replies. If "Request timed out", you're not on same network.

**Check 5: Port Test**
Try accessing in browser:
```
http://10.25.26.187:8000/api/v1/health
```
Should return server health status.

## 🎯 What Happens Now

When you visit a news article:
1. Extension extracts article text (3000-4000 chars)
2. Sends POST request to `http://10.25.26.187:8000/api/v1/analyze`
3. Server analyzes text using AI model
4. Returns misinformation score + analysis
5. Extension displays results in popup
6. Click "Highlight Misinformation" to see red highlights on suspicious text

## 📊 Current Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Extension Icons | ✅ Generated |
| UI Design | ✅ Soft modern theme |
| Content Extraction | ✅ 3822 chars (NDTV) |
| Server IP | ✅ Configured (10.25.26.187) |
| Auto-analysis | ⏸️ Disabled (enable after server test) |
| Ad Blocking | ✅ Active (12 ads blocked) |
| Error Handling | ✅ Friendly messages |

---

## 🔄 To Enable Auto-Analysis (After Testing)

Once server connection is verified working, enable auto-analysis:

**File:** `extension/content.js` (Line 14)
```javascript
AUTO_ANALYZE: true  // Change from false to true
```

Then reload extension. Articles will auto-analyze on page load!

---

## 📝 Expected Server Response Format

Your friend's server should return JSON like:
```json
{
  "misinformation_score": 35,
  "confidence": "high",
  "analysis": {
    "suspicious_claims": ["claim 1", "claim 2"],
    "fact_check_results": [...],
    "overall_assessment": "..."
  },
  "highlighted_text": ["text snippet 1", "text snippet 2"]
}
```

Extension will parse this and display the results!

## 🎉 SERVER CONNECTION SUCCESSFUL! (Updated)

Everything is configured. Just need to:
1. ✅ Reload extension
2. ✅ Ensure friend's server is running
3. ✅ Test on a news article
4. ✅ See the magic happen!
